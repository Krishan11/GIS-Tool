GIS Tool using Java, showing Emperors, wars and Important Battles During the Rise and Fall of Roman Empire
The focus of this tool is to show the emperors, wars and important battles during the
rise and fall of The Roman Empire. This is a geographic computer interactive and user
friendly tool which could be considered as a supplement to text book learning. This approach
provides an effective way of learning for the students as itâ€™s easy to use and more aligned to
the interests of the younger generation. In this tool, the user can click on the various points
located (the points are of the battles) on the world map which will open up a webpage for that
point giving up the detailed information of that battle as to how it started, between whom,
where it happened, what were the casualties in the battle from both sides, who won it and the
background information about the Emperors involved in those battles.
Apart from the information about the Roman Empire students have the ability to
customize the tool to suit their individual interests, select layers of their choice and click to
know more about the places on the map. This tool uses Java as programming language and
uses Map Objects Java Objects (MOJO) which is provided by ESRI, which is an
international supplier of GIS software. MOJO is very effective as using it GIS related
features can be included in the application. This tool has been developed taking into
considerations the both university and high school students and hence its interface has been
kept simple and straightforward without any compromise on the knowledge which the
students gain from this tool.

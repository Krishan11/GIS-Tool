Arsinoe IV of Egypt was born in between 68 to 56 BC and was youngest daughter of Macedonian king Ptolemy XII Auletes of Egypt and half sister of Cleopatra VII and Ptolemy XIII.In the times of the Alexandrian war,she led the forces against the forces of Cleopatra and Julius Caesar.In 48 BC Arsinoe escaped from Caesar as he captured the Ptolemaic royal family and joined the Egyptian army which was headed by Achillas.When Achillas and Ganymedes clashed with each other ,Arsinoe had Achillas executed and Ganymedes became the head of the army.Egyptian officers were not satisfied with Ganymedes and they asked Arsinoe to be transported to Rome and was forced to appear in Caesars army.Cleopatra was not happy with this as she saw her as a threat to her power ordered Mark Antony to kill Arsinoe on the steps of temple.<P></FONT></FONT></FONT>
